# Bestbuy-Scalper
The Bestbuy scalper is a simple Python script that removes the stresses of waiting for a product to go on sale. Although it's still in development and extensive bug testing, its goal is to use a provided link to a BestBuy product and check every second until it sees it go for sale. For instance, an Nvidia 3080 gpu. Once it's done inputting your account information, it will then add the item to your cart and continue to the checkout so it can have the sweet 15-minute reservation. After all this, it will then send you a message to a provided phone number or email to let your know that your item is ready.
